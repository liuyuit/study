- Legend tells of a legendary warrior
- whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
- He traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
- I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
- The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full.
- Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.
- Enough talk. Let's fight!
- Shashabooey!
- He was so deadly in fact,
- that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness.
- My eyes!   -He's too awesome!
- And attractive.   -How can we repay you?
- There is no charge for awesomeness.
- Or attractiveness.
- Kablooey!
- It mattered not how many foes he faced.
- They were no match for his bodacity!
- Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.
- Even the most heroic heroes in China,
- the Furious Five,
- bowed in respect to this great master.
- We should hang out.
- Agreed.
- But hanging out would have to wait.
- Because when you're facing the 10000 demons of Demon Mountain,
- there's only one thing that matters and that's...
- Po! Get up!
- You'll be late for work!
- What?
- Po! Get up!
- Po! What are you doing up there?
- Nothing.
- Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!
- Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
- Coming!
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
- What were you doing up there? all that noise.
- Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
- About what?
- What were you dreaming about?
- What was I...
- I was dreaming about
- noodles.
- Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
- Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
- Careful! That soup is sharp.
- Oh, happy day!
- My son, finally having the noodle dream!
- You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
- This is a sign, Po.
- A sign of what?
- You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient
- of my Secret lngredient Soup.
- Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
- As I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father
- who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong.
- Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.
- No, it was the dream.
- We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
- But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
- Something besides noodles?
- Actually, when I was young and crazy,
- I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
- Why didn't you?
- Because it was a stupid dream.
- Can you imagine me making tofu?
- Tofu.
- No! We all have our place in this world.
- Mine is here, and yours is...
- I know, is here.
- No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12.
- Service with a smile.
- Well done, students, If you were trying to disappoint me.
- Tigress, you need more freocity! Monkey, greater speed.
- Crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...
- Master Shifu.   -What?
- It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
- Master Oogway, you summoned me? Is something wrong?
- Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
- So, nothing's wrong?
- Well, I didn't say that.
- You were saying?
- I have had a vision.
- Tai Lung will return.
- That is impossible! He is in prison.
- Nothing is impossible.
- Zeng!
- Fly to Chor Ghom Prison and tell them
- to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!
- Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
- Yes, Master Shifu!
- One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
- We have to do something!
- We can't let him march on the valley and take his revenge!
- He'll...
- Your mind is like this water, my friend.
- When it is agitated, it becomes difficuit to see.
- But if you allow it to settle,
- the answer becomes clear.
- The Dragon Scroll.
- It is time.
- But who? Who is woryhy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
- To become the Dragon Warrior?
- I don't know.
- Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
- Watch it, Po!
- Sorry.  -Suck it up!
- Sorry.- -A thousand pardons.
- What?
- Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
- Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!
- One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
- We've been waiting a thousand years for this!
- Take the bowl!
- This is the greatest day in kung fu history!
- Don't worry about it. Just go!
- Po! Where are you going?
- To the Jade Palace.
- You're forgetting your noodle cart.
- The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
- Selling noodles?
- But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...
- Yeah?  -I was thinking maybe I...
- could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
- That's my boy!
- I told you that dream was a sign.
- Yeah. Glad I had it.
- I'm a kung fu warrior!   -Me, too!
- There's spots at the top.   -Let's go.
- Come on. Come on!
- Almost there.
- What?
- No! Oh, no!
- Sorry, Po.   -We'll bring you back a souvenir.
- No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
- It is an historic day.
- Isn't it, Master Oogway?
- Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see.
- Are your students ready?
- Yes, Master Oogway.
- Know this, old friend.
- Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley
- but also to you.
- Let the tournament begin!
- Yeah.
- No, no, wait!
- I'm coming! Wait, wait!
- Yes!
- Hey! Open the door!
- Let me in!
- Citizens of the Valley of Peace,
- It is my great honor to present to you, Tigress!
- Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!
- The Furious Five!
- Yeah, the Furious Five!
- Warriors, prepare!
- Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.
- Ready for battle!   -Yeah.
- The Thousand Tongues of Fire.
- Look at that.
- Hey! Get out of the way!
- And finally, Master Tigress!
- Believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet.
- I know!
- Master Tigress! Face iron Ox and his Blades of Death.
- I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
- Citizens of the Valley of Peace,
- Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!
- Oh, no! No, no, wait!
- Yeah.
- Po!
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing? Stop!
- I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
- But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
- I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.
- I love kung fu!
- Come on, son. Let's get back to work.
- Okay.
- Come back!
- What's going on?
- Where...
- What are you pointing...
- Okay. Sorry.
- I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
- How interesting.
- Master, are you pointing at me?
- Him.  -Who?
- You.   -Me?
- The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
- What?   -What?
- What?   -What?
- Stop, wait! Who told you to...
- Master Oogway, wait.
- That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
- You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!
- That was just an accident!
- There are no accidents.
- Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
- No. if the panda has not quit by morning,
- then I will have failed you.
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I bring a message
- from Master Shifu.
- What?
- Double the guard"?
- Extra precautions"?
- Your prison may not be adequate"?
- You doubt my prison security?
- Absolutely not.
- Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
- I'll give you a message for your Master shifu.
- Escape from Chor Ghom Prison is impossible!
- Impressive, isn't it?
- It's very impressive.
- It's very impressive.
- One way in, one way out.
- One thousand guards and one prisoner.
- Yes, except that prisoner
- is Tai Lung.
- Take us down.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my.
- Behold Tai Lung.
- I'm just gonna wait right here.
- It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
- Crossbows! At the ready!
- Crossbows?
- Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
- Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.
- What are you doing? Don't get him mad.
- What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
- Did I step on the wittle kitfy's tail?
- I'm good. I've seen enough.
- I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.
- No, he doesn't.
- I'll tell him that.
- Can we please go now?
- Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
- Wait a second!
- I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm...
- The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
- Look at this place.
- Master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage!
- The Sword of Heroes!
- Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking...
- The invisible Trident of Destiny!
- I've only seen paintings of that painting.
- No!
- The Legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
- Said to contain the souls Of the entire Tenshu army.
- Hello.
- Have you finished sight-seeing?
- Sorry, I should have come to you first.
- My patience is wearing thin.
- Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
- Would you turn around?   -Sure.
- How's it going?
- How do you get 5,000... Master Shifu!
- Someone broke that.
- But I'll fix it. Do you have some
- glue?
- A splinter.
- So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?
- I guess so.  -Wrong!
- You are not the Dragon Warrior.
- You will never be the Dragon Warrior until
- you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
- So, how does this work?
- Do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or...
- You think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret
- to limitless power?   -No, I...
- One must first master the highest level of kung fu.
- And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you.
- Someone like me?
- Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!
- Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
- And this ridiculous belly.
- And utter disregard for personai hygiene.
- Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
- Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.
- Listen, Oogway said I was...
- The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
- Oh, you know this hold?
- Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty. Yes.
- Then you know what happens when I flex my pinky.
- No, no!   -You know the hardest part of this?
- The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
- Okay, okay, take it easy.
- Now listen closely, panda.
- Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you,
- I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?
- Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.
- Good.
- I can't wait to get started.
- Let's begin.   -Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- Now?   -Yes, now.
- Unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
- Oh, okay, well...
- I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
- Well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we?
- Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
- What level is that?
- Well, I'm not a master, but
- let's just start at zero. level zero.
- No. There is no such thing as level zero.
- Maybe I can start with that.   -That?
- We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
- But if you insist...
- The Furious Five!
- You're so much bigger than your action figures.
- Except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.
- Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
- Are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work or something?
- Hit it.
- Okay, yeah. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting.
- So my kung fu might not be as good as later on.
- Just hit it.
- all right.
- What you got? You got nothing, 'cause I got it right here.
- You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.
- I'm coming at you with crazy feet. What you gonna do about crazy feet?
- Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
- You've only seen praying mantis.
- Or monkey style.
- Or I could come at you snickety-snake.
- Would you hit it!
- all right. all right.
- Why don't you try again? A little harder.
- How's that?
- That hurts.
- This will be easier than I thought.
- I'm feeling a little nauseous!
- Those are hard!
- My tenders.
- How did I do?
- There is now a level zero.
- There's no words.   -No denying that.
- I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking.
- The poor guy's gonna get himseif killed.
- He is so mighfy!
- The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
- When he walks, the very ground shakes!
- One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
- Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
- Or even see his toes.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Hi. You're up.
- I am now.
- I was just...
- Some day, huh?
- That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?
- I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so...
- Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.   -Okay, thanks.
- It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!
- You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
- Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just...
- Sorry about that.
- Look, you don't belong here.
- I know. I know. You're right.
- I don't have... I just...
- My whole life I dreamed of...
- No, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room.
- Property of Crane.
- Okay. Right, right.
- So, you want to get to sleep.
- Yeah.   -I'm keeping you up.
- We got big things tomorrow.
- all right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
- What was that?
- I didn't say anything.
- Okay. all right. Good night.
- Sleep well.
- That seemed a little awkward.
- Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you.
- You don't belong here.   -Yeah, of course.
- This is your room.
- I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
- You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have
- any respect for who we are and what we do,
- you will be gone by morning.
- Big fan!
- I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
- Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
- I understand. You eat when you are upset.
- Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset.
- So why are you upset?
- I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
- in the history of China. in the history of sucking!
- Probably.
- And the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me.
- Totally.
- How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
- I mean, I'm not like the Five.
- I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.
- Even Mantis has those thingies.
- Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
- Quit, don't quit.
- Noodles, don't noodles.
- You are too concerned with what was and what will be.
- There's a saying.
- Yesterday is history,
- tomorrow is a mystery,
- but today is a gift.
- That is why it is called the present.
- Oh, no!   -What's happening?
- To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!
- Fire crossbows!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.
- You're not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!   -Bring it up!
- Wait! Bring it back!
- He's coming this way!   -He won't get far. Archers!
- We're dead. So very, very dead.
- Not yet we're not. Now!
- Can we run now?   -Yes.
- I'm glad Shifu sent you.
- I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.
- Fly back there and tell them
- the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
- Good morning, Master!
- Panda!
- Panda!
- Wake up!
- He's quit.
- What do we do now, Master, with the panda gone?
- Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
- all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time,
- the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
- What are you doing here?
- Hi! Good morning, Master!
- I thought I'd warm up a little.
- You're stuck.
- Stuck? No. What? Stuck?
- No. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.
- Help him.   -Oh, dear.
- Maybe on three. One, two,
- three.
- Thank you.   -Don't mention it.
- No, really, I appreciate...   -Ever.
- You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
- It takes years to develop one's flexibility!
- And years longer to apply it in combat!
- Put that down!
- The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
- Yeah! Excellent.
- Let's get started.
- Are you ready?   -I was born ready...
- I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready.
- That was awesome! Let's go again!
- I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more.
- Your next opponent will be me.
- all right! Yeah, let's go!
- Step forth.
- The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness
- and make him suffer for it.
- Oh, yeah!
- To take his strength and use it against him
- until he finally falls
- or quits.
- A real warrior never quits.
- Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!
- If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
- But he will.
- He's not going to quit, is he?
- He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.
- I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
- Trust me, it will.
- It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
- Fat?   -Fur. I was going to say fur.
- Sure you were.
- Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
- I'm over here.
- Maybe you should look at this again.
- Oh, okay.
- Stop it. Stop!
- I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all,
- but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
- I know he can seem kind of heartless,
- but he wasn't always like that.
- According to legend,
- there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
- No!   -Yes.
- But that was before.
- Before what?
- Before Tai Lung.
- We're not really supposed to talk about him.
- Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
- Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.
- He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
- And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
- He wasn't just a student.
- Shifu found him as a cub
- and he raised him as his son.
- And when the boy showed talent in kung fu,
- Shifu trained him.
- He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
- It was never enough for Tai Lung.
- He wanted the Dragon Scroll.
- But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
- Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
- He tried to take the scroll by force.
- And Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
- But how could he?
- Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
- Or since.
- And now he has a chance to make things right.
- To train the true Dragon Warrior.
- And he's stuck with you.
- A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
- That is it!
- Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
- And may have also stopped his heart.
- inner peace.
- inner peace.
- inner...
- inner peace.
- Would whoever is making thatflapping sound quiet down?
- inner...
- Oh, Zeng.
- Excellent.
- I could use some good news right now.
- Master! Master!
- I have... it's... it's very bad news.
- Shifu.
- There is just news. There is no good or bad.
- Master, your vision... Your vision was right.
- Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
- That is bad news
- If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
- The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
- He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
- There are no accidents.
- Yes, I know. You've said that already.
- Twice.  -Well, that was no accident, either.
- Thrice.
- My old friend,
- the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
- until you let go of the illusion of control.
- Illusion?
- Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
- I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,
- nor make it bear fruit before its time.
- But there are things we can control.
- I can control when the fruit will fall.
- And I can control
- where to plant the seed.
- That is no illusion, Master.
- Yes.
- But no matter what you do
- that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
- You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
- But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
- Maybe it can.
- If you are willing to guide it.
- To nurture it.
- To believe in it.
- But how? How?
- I need your help, Master.
- No, you just need to believe.
- Promise me, Shifu.
- Promise me you will believe.
- I will try.
- Good.
- My time has come.
- You must continue your journey without me.
- What are you... Wait!
- Master!
- You can't leave me!
- You must believe.
- Master!
- 
- you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province,
- but you're a lousy tipper."
- Really? So how did you get out of there allve?
- I mean, I didn't actually say that,
- but I thought it
- in my mind.
- If he could read my mind, he'd be, like, "What?"
- Order up! Hope you like it.
- This is really good!   -No, come on.
- Try my dad's Secret lngredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
- What are you talking about? This is amazing!
- You're a really good cook.   -I wish my mouth was bigger.
- Tigress, you've got to try this.
- It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time
- on nothing but the dew of a single ginkgo leaf
- and the energy of the universe.
- I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
- I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
- What?   -Nothing, Master Shifu.
- You'll never be the Dragon Warrior
- unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
- What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
- Work hard, panda, and maybe someday
- you will have ears like mine.
- That's good.
- Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
- It's Shifu!
- Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
- Master Shifu!
- You think this is funny?
- Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
- What?   -He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,
- and you are the only one who can stop him.
- And here I am saying you got no sense of humor.
- I'm gonna stop Tai Lung.
- What? You're serious? And I have to...
- Master Oogway will stop him, he did it before, he'll do it again.
- Oogway cannot!
- Not anymore.
- Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
- The panda?   -Yes, the panda!
- Master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
- No! it is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
- It is his!
- Where'd he go?
- You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.
- Watch me.
- Come on.
- How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
- You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
- You don't believe that. You never believed that.
- From the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me.
- Yes! I was.
- But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
- You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
- Then why didn't you quit?
- You knew I was trying to get rid of you, yet you stayed.
- Yeah, I stayed.
- I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head
- or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more
- than it did every day of my life just being me.
- I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me,
- could make me not me,
- It was you,
- the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
- But I can change you!
- I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
- Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
- Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you
- gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?
- How?
- How?
- How?   -I don't know!
- I don't know.
- That's what I thought.
- This is what you trained me for.
- Tigress!
- Don't try and stop me.
- We're not trying to stop you.
- What?
- We're coming with you!
- What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
- No need to explain.
- I thought you might be Monkey.
- He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
- Don't tell Monkey.
- Look at you.   -Yeah, I know, I disgust you.
- No, I mean, how did you get up there?
- I don't know. I guess...
- I don't know. I was getting a cookie.
- Yet you are ten feet of the ground.
- And have done a perfect spilt.
- No, this? This is just...
- an accident.
- There are no accidents.
- Come with me.
- I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fury,
- but could you at least tell me where we're going?
- You dragged me
- all the way out here
- for a bath?
- Panda,
- we do not wash our pits in the pool of Sacred Tears.
- The pool of...
- This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries
- of harmony and focus.
- This is the birthplace
- of kung fu.
- Do you want to learn kung fu?
- Yeah!
- Then I am your master!
- Okay!
- Don't cry.
- Okay.
- When you focus on kung fu,
- when you concentrate,
- you stink.
- Perhaps that is my fault.
- I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
- I now see that the way to get through to you
- is with this.
- Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.
- Good.
- When you have been trained, you may eat.
- Let us begin.
- After you, panda.
- Just like that?
- No sit-ups? No 10-mile hike?
- I vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
- Enjoy.
- Hey!
- I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
- Hey!
- You are free to eat.
- Am I?   -Are you?
- I'm not hungry.
- Master.
- Cut it!
- Where's the Dragon Warrior?
- How do you know you're not looking at her?
- You think I'm a fool?
- I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
- I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.
- That he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
- Po?   -So that is his name. Po.
- Finally, a worthy opponent.
- Our battle will be legendary!
- We've got this. Help her.
- Monkey!
- Come!
- What was I thinking?
- Mantis!
- Now!
- Shifu taught you well.
- But he didn't teach you everything.
- You have done well, panda.
- Done well? Done well?
- I've done awesome!
- The mark of a true hero is humility.
- But, yes, you have done
- awesome.
- Guys? Guys? They're dead!
- No, they're breathing. They're asleep? No, their eyes are open.
- We were no match for his never attack.
- He's gotten stronger.
- Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
- He's too fast!
- Sorry, Po.
- I thought we could stop him.
- He could have killed you.
- Why didn't he?
- So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.
- It might. I mean, a little.
- I'm pretty scared.
- You can defeat him, panda!
- Are you kidding? If they can't?
- They're five masters. I'm just one me.
- But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
- You really believe I'm ready?
- You are,
- Po.
- Behold the Dragon Scroll.
- It is yours.
- Wait. What happens when I read it?
- No one knows.
- But legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
- Really? That's cool.
- Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
- You will feel the universe in motion around you.
- Can I punch through walls?
- Can I do a quadruple back flip?   -Focus.
- will I have invisibility...   -Focus.
- Focus. -Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.
- Read it and become
- the Dragon Warrior.
- It's impossible to open.
- Okay. Come on, baby. Come on, now.
- Thank you.
- I probably loosened it up for you though.
- Okay, here goes.
- It's blank.   -What?
- Here, look.   -No, I am for bidden to look upon...
- Blank. I don't...
- I don't understand.
- Okay. So, like,
- Oogway was\njust a crazy old turtle after all.
- No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
- Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.
- Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
- But who will stop Tai Lung?
- He'll destroy everything and everyone.
- No.
- Evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
- What about you, Master?   -I will fight him.
- What?   -I can hold him off long enough
- for everyone to escape.
- But, Shifu, he'll kill you.
- Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
- Listen to me, all of you.
- It is time for you to continue your journey without me.
- I am very proud to have been your master.
- We've got to get them out safely.
- Come, little one. Let's find your mama.
- Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north.
- Crane, light the way.
- Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
- Hey, Dad.
- Po!
- Good to have you back, son.
- Good to be back.
- Let's go, Po.
- So for our next shop, it's time to face it,
- the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
- no longer slices.
- Also, I was thinking, maybe this time
- we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
- You like that?
- Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
- It just wasn't meant to be.
- Po, forget every thing else.
- Your destiny still awaits.
- We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
- I don't know, Dad.
- Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
- Po,
- I think it's time I told you something I should have told you
- a long time ago.
- Okay.
- The secret ingredient of my Secret lngredient Soup.
- Come here. The secret ingredient is
- nothing.
- You heard me. Nothing!
- There is no secret ingredient!
- Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
- You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
- Don't have to. To make something special,
- you just have to believe it's special.
- There is no secret ingredient.
- I have come home, Master.
- This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
- Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.
- So where is this Po?
- Did I scare him off?
- This battle is between you and me.
- So, that is how it's going to be.
- That is how it must be.
- I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
- Obeying your master is not weakness!
- You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
- You always knew.
- But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?
- What did you do?
- Nothing!
- You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
- Not your fault?
- Who filled my head with dreams?
- Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?
- Who denied me my destiny?
- It was never my decision to make!
- It is now.
- Give me the scroll!
- I would rather die.
- all I ever did, I did to make you proud!
- tell me how proud you are, Shifu!
- tell me!
- tell me!
- I have...I have always been proud of you.
- From the first moment, I've been
- proud of you.
- And it was my pride
- that blinded me.
- I loved you too much to see what you were becoming,
- what I
- was turning you into.
- I'm...
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want your apology.
- I want my scroll!
- What?
- Where is it?
- Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
- You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.
- Never.
- Never.
- Stairs.
- Who are you?
- Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
- You?
- Him? He's a panda.
- You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
- Don't tempt me.
- No. I'm gonna use this.
- You want it? Come and get it.
- Finally!
- That scroll is mine!
- Lightning!
- The scroll has given him power!
- No!
- Finally! Oh, yes.
- The power of the Dragon scroll is mine!
- It's nothing!
- It's okay. I didn't get it the first time, either.
- What?
- There is no secret ingredient.
- It's just you.
- Stop it!
- I'm gonna pee.
- Don't.
- Don't! Don't!
- You
- can't defeat me.
- You...
- You're just a big
- fat
- panda!
- I'm not a big fat panda.
- I'm the big fat panda.
- The Wuxi Finger Hold!
- Oh, you know this hold?
- You're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that.
- Nope.
- I figured it out. Skadoosh.
- Look!
- The Dragon Warrior.
- That's my boy! That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
- Yes!
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hey, guys.
- Master.
- Master.
- Master?
- Master Shifu!
- Master!
- Shifu, are you okay?
- Po.
- You're allve.
- Or we're both dead.
- No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung.
- You did?
- Wow. it is as Oogway foretold.
- You are the Dragon Warrior.
- You have brought peace
- to this valley
- and...
- And to me.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Po.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please!
- I'm not dying, you idiot!
- Dragon Warrior.
- I am simply at peace. Finally.
- So, I should stop talking?
- If you can.
- Want to get something to eat?
- Yeah.
- 
- Everybody is kung fu fighting
- Your mind becomes fast as lightning
- Although the future is a little bit frightening
- It's the book of your life that you're writing
- Everybody is kung fu fighting
- Your mind becomes fast as lightning
- Although the future is a little bit frightening
- It's the book of your life that you're writing

- The journey's a lonely one So much more than we know
- But sometimes you've got to go And be your own hero

传说中有一位传说级的侠客{\r}
他的功夫就如传说一样高深莫测{\r}
他云游天下,只为寻找可匹敌的对手{\r}
“看你很能吃,吃我一拳如何！”{\r}
大侠未发一言,自顾从容咀嚼{\r}
只见他缓缓咽下，开口道:{\r}
"少废话,开打吧!"{\r}
看 招！{\r}
他果然出手不凡，招招制敌{\r}
直打的敌手眼冒金星,纷纷跪地求饶{\r}
-亮瞎了! -他太厉害了!{\r}
-而且好酷呢  -大侠之恩吾等何以为报？{\r}
行侠仗义乃英雄本色{\r}
何须报答!{\r}
招!{\r}
无论面对多少敌手{\r}
却无人可与匹敌！{\r}
从未有谁像这位熊猫一样：令敌胆寒，又为民所爱!{\r}
就连已名震天下的几位英雄侠客:{\r}
"虎胆五侠！"{\r}-  （注意原作海报。盖世五侠也可）{\r}
也向这位传奇大侠甘拜下风{\r}
跟你混了{\r}
可以{\r}
但一起混只怕没那么容易{\r}
因为他们闯入了恶魔山，正面临万千暴徒{\r}
他们只有一个选择,那就是...{\r}
阿波！ 起床了!{\r}
你要迟到了!{\r}
啥?!{\r}
阿波!快起床!{\r}
阿波,你在楼上搞什么?{\r}
啊,没干啥{\r}
猴王、螳螂、灵鹤、俏小龙、悍娇虎{\r}
阿波！快点！怎么这么慢{\r}
来了{\r}
对不起,老爸{\r}
对不起又不能当面吃{\r}
你到底在楼上搞什么？叮叮咣咣的{\r}
哦，没什么,只是做了个奇怪的梦{\r}
什么梦?{\r}
你梦到什么啦?{\r}
我梦到...呃...{\r}
梦到..那个...{\r}
呃...面条..{\r}
面条?你真的梦到了面条?{\r}
对啊,不然还能梦到什么?{\r}
小心！那面汤，很烫...{\r}
噢,太高兴了{\r}
我儿子，终于梦见面条了{\r}
你无法想象,我等这一刻等了多久{\r}
这是好兆头啊，阿波{\r}
什么好兆头？{\r}
意思是，现在就差不多可以..{\r}
..把我祖传汤面的祖传秘方传授给你了{\r}
到时你就能完成自己的使命，继承咱家祖传的面店了！{\r}
就像之前你爷爷把店传给我，再之前你祖爷爷把店传给你爷爷{\r}
再再之前你祖爷爷打麻将从朋友那赢来这店一样..{\r}
老爸,老爸,我只是做个梦而已{\r}
不,那是启示之梦{\r}
我们可是面条世家,连血管里都流着面汤{\r}
可是老爸,你就没想过...去..干点别的吗？{\r}
不只是一辈子卖面条{\r}
不瞒你说啊,你爹我年少轻狂的时候{\r}
曾想过离家出走,去学做豆腐呢{\r}
那你怎么没去?{\r}
因为那只是痴人说梦啊{\r}
我，怎么可能会去做豆腐?{\r}
豆腐...{\r}
算!命有天注定{\r}
我就卖面的命,而你天生就该…{\r}
我知道,也是卖面{\r}
错!是送面！2桌、5桌、7桌、12桌{\r}
记住：微笑服务{\r}
打得好！徒儿们！好的..一塌糊涂！{\r}
娇虎,力度不够！猴王,出手太慢！{\r}
灵鹤,注意高度！俏蛇,不够敏锐！螳螂...{\r}
-“师傅”大师 -干嘛？！{\r}
是，是“乌龟”大师,他要见您{\r}
乌龟仙师,您召见我,出什么事了吗?{\r}
难道 非要出什么事我才能找你吗,老友?{\r}
那，就是没事咯?{\r}
嗯..也不能说没事{\r}
您是想说?{\r}
吾有一预感：{\r}
太郎，将重现江湖！{\r}
不可能！他还被关在大牢里{\r}
天下无不可能之事{\r}
小曾!{\r}
我要你即刻赶往楚岗大牢,{\r}
叫他们把狱卒加倍！兵器加倍！统统都要加倍!{\r}
绝不能让太郎逃出大牢!{\r}
遵命!师傅!{\r}
“子欲避之，反促遇之”{\r}
我们一定得采取行动{\r}
绝不能让他闯入和平谷，使百姓再遭毒手！{\r}
不然.不然..{\r}
我的朋友，你的思绪正如这水面{\r}
一旦浮躁波动,就难以明晰{\r}
但，若你能平心静气{\r}
答案自然显现{\r}
神龙卷轴{\r}
时候到了{\r}
谁呢?究竟谁能有资格担起重任，修此无上神功？{\r}
成为神龙大侠呢？{\r}
我亦不知{\r}
不好意思,借过，借过{\r}
嗨，看着点，阿波{\r}
对不起,预备，收腹!{\r}
对不起，实在抱歉{\r}
什么?!{\r}
乌龟仙师要选出神龙大侠?! 就在今天!{\r}
各位客官！各位！快! 快去玉宫！{\r}
盖世五侠要开始争夺神龙卷轴了！{\r}
这可是千年不遇的盛事啊！{\r}
快去！碗你端走！{\r}
这可是功夫史上最重要的一天啊！{\r}
不用结账啦!快走!快!{\r}
阿波!你要去哪?{\r}
去那个，玉宫{\r}
但你忘了带面条推车{\r}
到时整个和平谷的人都会去那儿，你正好可以大卖一笔{\r}
还要卖面啊?{\r}
老爸,我是想说，或许我..{\r}
-嗯? -我在想我搞不好还可以...{\r}
嗯哼?{\r}
可以顺便卖卖豆包，省的放坏了...{\r}
这才是我儿！{\r}
我就说那梦是个好兆头嘛！{\r}
是啊,我真是做了个好梦...{\r}
-嘿嘿,我是功夫大侠  -我也是{\r}
-就是那个地方  -好，咱们快{\r}
加把劲，加把劲啊！{\r}
就快到了{\r}
啊?!{\r}
不..不..别这样...{\r}
-可怜的阿波  -我们会帮你带个纪念品的{\r}
不,我要自己拿纪念品{\r}
这将是彪炳史册的一天{\r}
您说是吗,乌龟仙师?{\r}
是啊,我曾以为自己活不到这一天了呢!{\r}
令徒都已就绪?{\r}
是的，仙师{\r}
听好了,老友{\r}
无论我选了谁,他将不仅把和平安宁带给谷中百姓{\r}
还有，你{\r}
盛典开始！{\r}
耶！
不！别！等等！{\r}
我来了！等我！别关门！{\r}
好极
喂！开门呐!{\r}

嘿,闪开别挡着!{\r}
压轴出场的是：悍娇虎！{\r}
各位，相信我，你们还没见识到真功夫！{\r}
我知道!{\r}
悍娇虎，即将大战钢铁牛之绝命刀{\r}
我感应到 神龙大侠就在我们中间。{\r}
各位和平谷的乡亲父老{\r}
乌龟仙师即将选出——神龙大侠！{\r}
啊?不，不,等等我{\r}
太好了！
噢!阿波！{\r}
你在搞什么鬼?{\r}
哎,你自己不会看啊？别,别吹{\r}
我一定要去看神龙大侠！{\r}
你把我都搞糊涂了!不才做的面条之梦吗？!{\r}
我骗你的,老爸,其实我没有梦到面条{\r}
我爱功夫！{\r}
噢，算了吧,儿,还是乖乖回家卖面吧{\r}
好吧{\r}
回来啊!{\r}
现在什么情况?{\r}
这是…{\r}
你在指什么啊?{\r}
噢！抱歉！对不起{\r}
我只想看看到底谁是神龙大侠{\r}
真有意思{\r}
仙师，您..您是在指我吗?{\r}
-是他  -谁?{\r}
-你  -我?{\r}
天意降赐！神龙大侠终于现身了!{\r}
-什么?! -什么?!{\r}
-什么?! -什么?!{\r}
停下!慢着!谁让你们..{\r}
乌龟仙师,请留步{\r}
那个脑满肠肥的熊猫怎么可能是神龙大侠？！{\r}
您本来要指悍娇虎,这家伙突然从天而降挡住了她！{\r}
这只是个意外!{\r}
世上无意外{\r}
师傅,徒儿无能,辜负了您的期望{\r}
不,如果明早那熊猫还没跑路{\r}
那才是我辜负了尔等{\r}
且慢! 等等，等等!我带了口信来{\r}
是师傅的{\r}
什么？{\r}
叫我增加守卫？{\r}
还要严加警觉？{\r}
你们大牢并非固若金汤？{\r}
你竟敢质疑我们大牢的安全？！{\r}
绝对不敢！{\r}
是师傅,我只是传他口信{\r}
把我的话带给你的“师傅”大师{\r}
想从楚岗大牢逃跑？势比登天!{\r}
怎么样，吓到了吧?{\r}
是,吓...吓到了{\r}
真的..非常严密..非常厉害!{\r}
入狱有路，越狱无门！{\r}
一千名狱卒,看守一名囚犯{\r}
没错,只不过...{\r}
那个囚犯是太郎{\r}
送我们下去{\r}
你在干嘛？{\r}
我天..{\r}
屏息瞧好，这就是太郎！{\r}
那个...我就在这等你好了{\r}
怕什么,这里安全得很{\r}
十字弓待命! {\r}
十字弓?!{\r}
嘿,牛人,听见没?{\r}
老乌龟终于要把神龙卷轴送人了,可惜，那个人不是你{\r}
你这干嘛?! 别惹他啊!{\r}
惹他又如何,他现在连根小指头都动不了{\r}
噢!我好像不小心踩了小猫咪的尾巴？是不是？{\r}
够了,我看够了{\r}
我会转告师傅是他多虑了{\r}
对,没错{\r}
我会转告他{\r}
咱们可以走了吗?{\r}
神龙 大侠!  神龙 大侠!…{\r}
等一等！{\r}
我想可能有点小误会，各位似乎以为我是那个..呃..{\r}
噢...这里是英雄圣殿！不是吧！{\r}
难以置信！{\r}
这？飞天铁犀侠的战甲！还带着史诗之战的伤痕!{\r}
英雄之刃!{\r}
传说它锋利无比,光是瞄一眼就会割..{\r}
这..命运之隐形三叉戢耶！{\r}
天!这幅画我只见过临摹版的临摹版{\r}
我了个去！{\r}
传说中的幻语英灵瓮！{\r}
据说整个天书军团的英灵被供奉其中{\r}
有人吗{\r}
请问你参观完了没有?{\r}
对不起,我应该先来拜见你的{\r}
我快失去耐性了{\r}
哦？好像，您也去不了哪儿啊？{\r}
-你能转过身吗?   -没问题{\r}
嘿,怎样?{\r}
你是怎么把五千个…噢!师傅!{\r}
有人把这个打破了..{\r}
但我会把它黏好的，我会…你有没有{\r}
胶水?{\r}
啊，扎手{\r}
貌似，您就是传说中的神龙大侠了?{\r}
-我想是吧! -错!{\r}
你不是神龙大侠! {\r}
你永远当不了神龙大侠..{\r}
..除非你掌握了神龙卷轴的无上秘笈{\r}
那...我要怎么拿啊?{\r}
您这有没有梯子...蹦床也行..或者..{\r}
你真以为这么简单？我就这么乖乖地..{\r}
-把神龙卷轴的秘笈神功双手奉上?   -不,我只是...{\r}
首先那个人必须精通十八般武艺，造诣非凡..{\r}
..看你这德性也知道你根本就不是那种人! 想都别想!{\r}
我这德性?{\r}
对,瞧瞧！这大屁股!肥胳膊!{\r}
我这肥胳膊可很怕疼的{\r}
还有这笑死人的大肚皮{\r}
还有不洗澡不刷牙不讲个人卫生{\r}
等一下下,您这说的可有点过分了{\r}
站远点！省的你那口臭冲过来{\r}
是这样,乌龟仙师都说了我就是...{\r}
这！这是无式销魂指?! 别用无式销魂指!{\r}
呵...你也知道这一招?{\r}
第三王朝时期无锡大师的独创绝招,我了解…{\r}
哦？那你一定也知道，我这小指一弹会怎么样咯…{\r}
-不不不!千万别！  -你知道最难的是什么?{\r}
最难的是 清理满地的肉屑残渣！{\r}
好,您放松，您消气...{\r}
你给我听清楚！熊猫{\r}
没错，乌龟仙师是选了你，但等你到了我手上..{\r}
我保证你会希望——当初他没选你！听懂了没有？{\r}
懂…听懂了…真的听懂了{\r}
很好{\r}
我都等不及要开始了{\r}
-那就开始  -等等，等等{\r}
什么?{\r}
-现在吗? -没错，就现在{\r}
难道你承认乌龟仙师选错了人？…或，你根本就不是什么神龙大侠{\r}
噢,好吧..那个..{\r}
..我不太确定那些招式我能不能都做的了{\r}
嗯，你不试试，我们又怎会知道，是不是？{\r}
对… 也许..我们应该先从更适合我的那种等级开始{\r}
那你是哪一级的?{\r}
这个嘛...我又不是什么大师级..{\r}
..不如我们从头开始好了,从零级开始{\r}
噢，不行，这儿可没那种蠢蠢的零级{\r}
-不如，我先练练那个吧  -这个？{\r}
这是小孩专用的，夏天太热有时我们还用来顶门{\r}
但如果你坚持要试的话..{\r}
哇,盖世五侠!{\r}
你们真人可比玩偶大多了！{\r}
除了你,螳螂,你差不多和模型一般大{\r}
露两手吧,熊猫,让我们见识一下{\r}
呃...他们要站在旁边看吗? 还是..等他们走了我再开始？{\r}
出拳{\r}
好吧..可是..我刚吃过饭..正在消化{\r}
所以..现在我的功夫水平可能不如..过一会儿的好{\r}
出拳吧!{\r}
那好{\r}
你会什么..你什么都不会..有我在这.{\r}
敢招惹我的朋友？叫你尝尝我的厉害{\r}
我要使无影脚了，你能怎么办,哼?{\r}
来啊,晃你，还没见识过熊猫拳吧{\r}
你只见过螳螂拳{\r}
或猴拳{\r}
我还有蛇影手{\r}
你打还是不打？！{\r}
好的,好的{\r}
再来一拳,稍稍用力点{\r}
这拳…如何…{\r}
疼!{\r}
这比我预想的还要简单{\r}
我有点想吐{\r}
这都啥，这么硬?!{\r}
我的命根根…{\r}
还..不赖吧?{\r}
你现在的确是 第0级了{\r}
-我简直无语!  -没错{\r}
真不懂乌龟仙师怎么想的{\r}
那可怜的家伙差点练挂了！{\r}
他实在"太神了"{\r}
传说的神龙大侠，脚踩“祥云”，从天而降!{\r}
当他行走时，大地为之“震颤”{\r}
我一直以为乌龟至少选个真懂功夫的人吧{\r}
对,至少那种站着手能够到脚的人{\r}
哪怕能看到脚也行{\r}
准备{\r}
轻点{\r}
嗨…你醒啦{\r}
这下是了{\r}
我只是来…{\r}
这一天够忙吧{\r}
练功够累吧？你肱二头肌酸不酸？{\r}
我今天真的很累…而且很失望，所以..{\r}
是啊,真该早早休息了{\r}
-对对对,当然  -很好,谢了{\r}
我只是…哥们，我好崇拜你们啊！{\r}
你们在泣河之战的表现简直帅呆了！{\r}
不仅以一挡千,而且毫不畏惧。你们只消…{\r}
不好意思啊{\r}
呃...是这样，你不属于这里{\r}
我懂,我懂,没错{\r}
我甚至都…{\r}
..你知道吗，我一生最大的梦想就是…{\r}
不不,你误会了，我是指这里，你不该进来,这是我的房间{\r}
灵鹤栖息地{\r}
噢,对...对...{\r}
那…你现在要睡觉了{\r}
-对  -我一直在吵你{\r}
明天我们还要办大事呢{\r}
好,最后一句：你真酷毙了！拜拜{\r}
你刚说啥?{\r}
我什么都没说{\r}
哦哦,那好,晚安{\r}
好梦{\r}
似乎有点尴尬…{\r}
悍娇虎大侠！我不是故意吵醒你，我只是…{\r}
-你不属于这里-  -是,我明白{\r}
这儿是你的房间{\r}
不！我是说，你根本不配来到玉宫{\r}
你是功夫的耻辱 倘若你还对我们..{\r},
..和我们的所为抱有一丝敬意..{\r}
..天亮之前..你就该走人{\r}
崇拜你喔…{\r}
看起来你已经找到"圣智桃树"了{\r}
原来这是仙桃树啊? 真对不起,我以为这只是普通的桃树{\r}
我明白了,你一难过就大吃特吃{\r}
难过?我才没有 你你你…为什么这么说{\r}
说吧，你到底为什么难过?{\r}
我今天..真是挫爆了.. 很可能是功夫史上最挫的一个{\r}
很可能还是中国史上第一挫,挫人史上第一挫!{\r}
很可能{\r}
还有那五侠…你真是没见啊，他们简直是恨死我!{\r}
简直是{\r}
师傅怎么可能..把这家伙变成神龙大侠?{\r}
你看，我又不像五侠他们…{\r}
我没有虎爪、鹤翼、蛇毒{\r}
连螳螂都有那种…小锯锯{\r}
也许我真该早点放弃,回家卖面条算了{\r}
放弃？不放弃？{\r}
卖面？不卖面？{\r}
你太在意过去如何，以及未来将要如何了{\r}
俗话说得好{\r}
昨日虽多却已逝{\r}
未来可期仍未知{\r}
只有当下才是真啊！{\r}
这才是我们要活在当下的原因 (present双关语){\r}
-哦不！- -出什么事了?{\r}
各就各位！快！快！快！
发射十字弓!{\r}
发射!{\r}
发射!{\r}
太郎逃脱了!我要去报告师傅！{\r}
你哪也去不了!他也一样！{\r}
-放开我!- -拉上来!{\r}
等等,放下来!{\r}
-他冲上来啦!   -他跑不了。放箭!{\r}
我们死定了!这下真是死定了!{\r}
呵呵，早得很呢…放箭!{\r}
-可以跑了吗?   -好吧{\r}
很高兴师傅派你来{\r}
还以为大家都把我忘了{\r}
飞回去，告诉他们：{\r}
真正的神龙大侠要回来了{\r}
早安，师傅！{\r}
熊猫!{\r}
熊猫!{\r}
快起来!{\r}
他果然走了{\r}
师父,我们现在该怎么办? 熊猫一走..{\r}
..谁才是神龙大侠?{\r}
不必担心，只须重回训练，再假以时日..{\r}
真正的神龙大侠就会自然显现{\r}
你怎么还在这儿?！{\r}
嗨！师父,早上好！{\r}
我在做预热,伸展筋骨{\r}
你卡住了{\r}
卡住?哪有,怎么可能? 哈哈{\r}
没有,我只是在… 好吧,我卡住了{\r}
-去帮他   -受不了{\r}
数到三好了… 一,二{\r}
三!{\r}
-感激不尽  -不提谢{\r}
-不，我真的感谢..  -提也别提{\r}
你真以为自己可以在一夜之间练成一字马？{\r}
习武之人苦练多年才能练出柔韧性{\r}
然后，再苦练几年才能用于实战{\r}
给我放下!{\r}
在这里，我们只收集敌人的残肢断臂，以及烂骨头{\r}
耶! 太赞了!{\r}
让我们开练吧{\r}
-准备好没?  -尽管放马过…{\r}
真抱歉！小伙子，我还以为你准备好了{\r}
真是太酷了！再来一次!{\r}
我已经一直对你手下留情了,熊猫！但到此为止{\r}
你的下一个对手，就是我{\r}
好，耶!来吧{\r}
往前一步{\r}
取胜之道，在于找到你对手的弱点{\r}
并让他因之痛不欲生{\r}
没错！{\r}
借彼之力，还施彼身{\r}
直到他，倒地不起{\r}
或求饶认输{\r}
但真正的大侠绝不会认输{\r}
大师您放心好了,我绝对不会放弃!{\r}
他如果聪明的话，就不会再回来了{\r}
但是他会的{\r}
看他就是不肯放弃啊？是不是？{\r}
我看他是放弃不了肥球弹，瞧瞧{\r}
你不是说针灸会让我好起来吗？{\r}
相信我,会的{\r}
只是你身上的穴位太难找 这厚厚一层…{\r}
-脂肪?   -毛!我要说的是毛{\r}
才怪!{\r}
你说我有什么资格评判别人的身材呢? 看看我…{\r}
我在这边{\r}
也许你需要再看下这个...{\r}
噢...好的{\r}
住手!不要!{\r}
我知道，师傅很想激发我..{\r}
可能我想太多了,我老觉得他成心想要赶我走{\r}
的确，师父看起来有些冷酷{\r}
可他原本不是那样的人{\r}
传说…{\r}
..很久以前,师傅其实是笑口常开那种{\r}
-少来 -真的啊{\r}
但，那是在某事之前…{\r}
在什么之前？{\r}
在太郎之前{\r}
呃...对了,其实我们没必要提起他{\r}
嗯,如果他要继续留在这里，就应该告诉他{\r}
师兄师姐,我知道一点太郎的故事{\r}
他曾拜师父门下,而且是第一个精通九十九种绝学的弟子{\r}
后来，他变坏了,现在在坐牢{\r}
他可不是一般的弟子……{\r}
他本来是个弃婴{\r}
师父养他如子..{\r}
..从他展现出功夫异禀的那天起{\r}
师父就栽培他{\r}
信任他 并预言：他必将成为一代功夫大师{\r}
但，太郎野心太大{\r}
他想要得到神龙卷轴{\r}
而乌龟仙师却看出他心术不正,拒绝了他{\r}
恼羞成怒之下,太郎在谷中大开杀戒{\r}
企图强行夺取神龙卷轴{\r}
于是，师父不得不斩除自己种下的祸根{\r}
但…他怎么下的了手？{\r}
太郎不仅是师父的得意弟子,也是最受疼爱的那个{\r}
从未变过{\r}
现在…他终于有机会弥补旧错{\r}
调教出真正的神龙大侠{\r}
结果，却碰上了你…{\r}
…这个又肥又胖的熊猫 视练武如儿戏{\r}
噢！你够了!{\r}
等等,是我的错! 我不小心戳歪了他的脸肌穴位!{\r}
好像，还暂时戳停了心跳..{\r}
平心静气{\r}
平心静气{\r}
平心..{\r}
平心静气{\r}
是哪个家伙在后边呼扇呼扇的,给我安静!{\r}
平…{\r}
哦，小曾啊{\r}
太好了{\r}
现在正好需要你的好消息{\r}
大师！大师！{\r}
我有一个…一个…很坏的消息{\r}
啊，师傅{\r}
消息就是消息,没有好坏之分{\r}
大师,您的预感..预感果然是对的！{\r}
太郎他逃出了大牢,他杀回来了{\r}
这还真是个坏消息…{\r}
如果你不相信神龙大侠能阻止他{\r}
那个熊猫? 大师,那熊猫绝不可能是神龙大侠！{\r}
他根本就不应该出现在现场！那只是个意外{\r}
世事无意外{\r}
是，我知道,你已经说过…{\r}
-…两遍了.  -是啊，这也不是意外{\r}
三遍{\r}
老朋友{\r}
…若想让熊猫完成他的使命，还有你自己的{\r}
你就必须先抛开试图掌控一切的幻觉{\r}
幻觉?{\r}
是的,你看看这棵树{\r}
我没有办法要它随时开花{\r}
也没办法要它提前结果{\r}
但有些事我们是可以掌控的{\r}
我能控制这果实何时掉落{\r}
我还能掌控…{\r}
…在哪里播下种子{\r}
这些！可不是什么幻觉！大师{\r}
没错{\r}
只是不论你怎么做{\r}
这种子还是会长成桃树{\r}
可能你希望长出苹果或是橘子 但他只会长出桃子{\r}
可是桃子无法击败太郎啊！{\r}
或许，它真能呢？{\r}
如果你愿意去引导他{\r}
用心栽培他{\r}
真心相信他{\r}
怎么做?告诉我{\r}
大师,我需要你的帮助{\r}
不用,你只要相信就好{\r}
老朋友,答应我{\r}
答应我你会相信{\r}
我...我会...尽力{\r}
嗯...很好{\r}
我的时辰到了{\r}
你必须独自完成自己的使命,保重…{\r}
等等，你你你说…说什么?{\r}
大师!{\r}
您不能丢下我!{\r}
你一定要相信..{\r}
大师!{\r}
就算你是恶狼{\r}
"或是全福建最可怕的强盗{\r}
"但还是改不了你那卑鄙不正的勾当{\r}"
真的啊? 那你是怎么死里逃生的？{\r}
其实嘛..我没有真的说出来{\r}
腹诽而已{\r}
心里说说"{\r}
要是他会读心术，那他可能会："呵!胆挺肥啊"{\r}
面来啦，请慢用{\r}
-这汤真不错啊!  -别逗..{\r}
我爸的祖传汤面才叫棒，只有他知道里面放了什么秘方{\r}
干嘛这么谦虚,这真是人间美味{\r}
-哇哦,你厨艺很棒耶  -真希望嘴巴大一点{\r}
悍娇虎,你一定要尝尝{\r}
据传说…神龙大侠可以不吃东西..{\r}
..仅靠一滴露水和吸取宇宙能量..{\r}
..就能活好几个月{\r}
那样的话，可能我的身体还没意识到我已经是神龙大侠了…{\r}
我恐怕达不到什么"餐霞饮露"，还有宇宙的那什么东东{\r}
-干嘛?  -噢,没事,师父大人{\r}
你永远当不成神龙大侠{\r}
除非你减掉两百公斤！还要天天刷牙{\r}
你们吵什么，嬉皮笑脸的? 我就从来不笑{\r}
加油吧,熊猫，也许有一天…{\r}
你会长出像我这样的一对..{\r}
好好笑{\r}
招风耳。不好笑吗? 我还觉得挺逗的{\r}
是师父!{\r}
当然是在学师父,你以为呢?{\r}
师父！…是您啊！{\r}
亏你们还笑得出来?!{\r}
太郎已经从大牢脱逃 你们却在这跟小孩一样傻笑！{\r}
-什么?  -他是为夺取神龙卷轴而来{\r}
而你，是唯一可以阻止他的人！{\r}
哈哈,刚才还说师傅没有幽默感呢..{\r}
居然叫我去…阻止太郎{\r}
什么? 你没开玩笑? 真要我去?{\r}
不不…有乌龟仙师阻止他，他曾做到过，这次也可以{\r}
乌龟不能{\r}
再也不能了{\r}
我们唯一的希望…只有神龙大侠了{\r}
-是他吗?  -就是这熊猫!{\r}
师傅,求您了,让我们去！这正是您训练我们的目的啊！{\r}
不！击败太郎并非你等的使命{\r}
而是他的！{\r}
跑哪去了?{\r}
你不能走。真正的大侠绝不放弃！{\r}
瞧好了{\r}
我拜托{\r}
我怎么可能打败太郎？ 我连比赛爬台阶都输给你{\r}
你一定能打败他..因为你..是神龙大侠！{\r}
你根本就不相信 从来就没信过{\r}
从我踏入这里的第一刻起,你就一直想赶我走{\r}
没错！那是以前{\r}
但现在，我要你信任你的师父 就像我信任我的师父那样{\r}
你不是我师父，我也不是什么神龙大侠{\r}
那你为什么不放弃?{\r}
你明明知道我想赶你走 却又赖着不走{\r}
对,我不走…{\r}
我没走,是因为你每次丢砖块砸我头{\r}
或嫌我臭,都很伤我心！但这些都比不了以前那种..{\r}
..每天浑浑噩噩混日子做平庸的我，更伤我心的了！{\r}
我不走,是因为我以为，要是有人能改变我{\r}
让我不再…是那个我的{\r}
就只有你！{\r}
你这全中国最伟大的功夫大师！{\r}
我确能改变你！{\r}
我绝对能将你打造成为神龙大侠，而且一定会成功！{\r}
得了吧,太郎马上就要到了!{\r}
就算他要花一百年才能跑到这里，你要怎么做…{\r}
才能把这个…变成神龙大侠?{\r}
你说！{\r}
你说！{\r}
你说啊！  -我不知道!{\r}
我真不知道...{\r}
果然如此...{\r}
师父，您养兵千日，须用兵一时{\r}
悍娇虎！{\r}
你们不要拦我!{\r}
我们不是要拦你{\r}
什么？{\r}
我们是要跟你并肩作战！{\r}
干嘛? 我一难过就要大吃,不行吗?{\r}
噢,不必向我解释{\r}
我还以为你是猴王呢{\r}
他常把杏仁饼干藏在橱柜顶上{\r}
别告猴哥{\r}
-瞧瞧你  -是是,我懂,又让您恶心了{\r}
不是,我是说…你是怎么上去的?{\r}
不知道,我…反正就…{\r}
我不知道…我只是…要吃饼干{\r}
于是你竟一跃几米高{\r}
还做出了完美的一字马！{\r}
吶？你说这个吗? 这只是个…{\r}
..意外{\r}
世上没有意外的事{\r}
随我来{\r}
我知道你又在故弄玄虚,要带我练功{\r}
至少，你得告诉我这是要去哪儿吧？{\r}
你…这么大老远…{\r}
把我拖到这里{\r}
就为洗个澡?{\r}
熊猫{\r}
不可以用“圣泪天池”的水来洗胳肢窝{\r}
什么池?{\r}
乌龟正是在此潜心修炼{\r}
领悟武学最高境界，成为一代宗师{\r}
这里，便是：{\r}
功夫的发源地{\r}
你想不想学功夫?！{\r}
想!{\r}
那从此，我即汝师！{\r}
好的！
不准哭{\r}
遵命{\r}
当你一心一意…{\r}
专心练武的时候…{\r}
就搞臭！{\r}
也许这才是我的错{\r}
我不能再用训练五侠的老方法再教你{\r}
现在，我明白了，要想激发你..{\r}
只有靠这个{\r}
哦！太棒了,我快饿晕了{\r}
很好{\r}
等你练完功，就能吃咯{\r}
开始{\r}
您先请{\r}
啊？这么简单?{\r}
不用做倒挂金钟？也不用徒步百里?{\r}
为师既已发誓要训练你,而你已完成，当然可以吃了{\r}
请慢用{\r}
嘿！{\r}
我说了，你可以随意吃，来，夹个包子{\r}
干嘛你？！{\r}
请 随 君 意{\r}
-真随我意?! -对，随你真意！{\r}
我不饿{\r}
谢尊师{\r}
切断绳索！{\r}
哪位才是神龙大侠?{\r}
汝面前便是！{\r}
你当我傻?{\r}
我知道你根本就不是神龙大侠，你们五个人都不是!{\r}
我听说，他从天而降，脚踩火球{\r}
是那种武功绝伦，举世无双的大侠{\r}
-他在说阿波?   -原来神龙大侠尊名叫，阿波{\r}
终于，一个有价值的对手！{\r}
我们之间的战斗必将铭刻史册！{\r}
去帮她!{\r}
猴王!{\r}
来了!{\r}
这，这，你开玩笑啊!!{\r}
螳螂!
现在
果然…严师出高徒！{\r}
不过，他并未倾囊相授！{\r}
你最近表现很好,熊猫{\r}
"很好"? 就这?{\r}
我的表现 那真是酷爆了！!{\r}
真英雄 应虚怀谦卑才对。{\r}
不过,你的进步确实..{\r}
..很酷！{\r}
师兄!师姐!他们死了?!{\r}
没,还在呼吸！是睡死了?不,眼还睁着啊{\r}
我们都被他点穴击败{\r}
看来，他武功更强了{\r}
谁？太郎？ 更强了？{\r}
他出手真的太快了{\r}
抱歉打到你,阿波{\r}
原来，我们根本不是他的对手{\r}
他大可杀了你们{\r}
那他为什么不杀{\r}
他故意放五侠惨败而归，以便攻心 让我们惊惧，但这招不会得逞!{\r}
可能…我是说…还是有点效果的{\r}
这么厉害啊？！我真是有点怕啊！{\r}
你能打败他！熊猫{\r}
开什么玩笑！连五侠都..{\r}
盖世五侠啊！ 我只是一个人..{\r}
你不一样，我将传授你绝无仅有的神功…{\r}
你真相信我够格了?{\r}
没错！{\r}
阿波！{\r}
无上绝学，神龙卷轴！{\r}
就交给你了{\r}
等等,我看了卷轴会怎样?{\r}
没有人知道{\r}
但据传说 看了的人能听到蝴蝶振翅的微稀之音{\r}
哇，真的? 好酷!{\r}
真的,据说你眼力也会大增，还能暗中窥明..{\r}
并能感应整个宇宙万物的能量，使之为你所用{\r}
那我能一拳打穿墙吗?{\r}
-…是不是也能飞檐走壁了?  -专心点{\r}
-能隐身吗?   -专心点{\r}
-专心  -哦好的，好的{\r}
看吧，阿波，完成你的天赐使命{\r}
学吧，然后…{\r}
成为传说中的神龙大侠!{\r}
这根本..打不开嘛...{\r}
好啊，宝贝，别那么紧，开开啊！{\r}
谢谢{\r}
这..我刚才费劲半天先转松了，你才..{\r}
好,我要看了！{\r}
-怎么是空白的？  -什么?{\r}
-不信，你看   -不，不行！我没资格看神龙…{\r}
还真..空白的, 我真..{\r}
我真不明白{\r}
哦，我想，我明白了..{\r}
..原来..乌龟已经有点老年痴呆了，逗谁呢？是不是？{\r}
不,大师的智慧无人能及{\r}
拜 托！接受现实吧，他连选神龙大侠都靠胡蒙的！{\r}
我当然不是什么神龙大侠，骗谁啊我？{\r}
若真如此，那谁能阻止太郎?{\r}
他一定会摧毁一切,赶尽杀绝{\r}
不!{\r}
立刻疏散和平谷的百姓！你们有责任保护所有村民免遭杀害{\r}
-那你怎么办?师父-  -我留下对付他{\r}
-什么?！   -我可以先拖住他一段时间…{\r}
以保证大家平安逃离{\r}
可是，师父…他会杀了你！{\r}
那我也算弥补旧错了{\r}
听我说，徒儿们:{\r}
现在，你们必须独立完成自己的使命了！{\r}
能当你们的师父,我感到非常骄傲！{\r}
一定要平安护送村民撤离{\r}
来,小朋友,我帮你去找妈妈{\r}
俏小龙,立刻集合南村村民。螳螂,你去北村{\r}
灵鹤,你来开路{\r}
瞧瞧,那不“神龙大侠”嘛{\r}
嗨,老爸..{\r}
阿波!{\r}
回来就好,儿子{\r}
回来..就好{\r}
阿波,走吧{\r}
看来，我们必须面对现实，考虑下一步了{\r}
以后做面，菜都要切成丁,不再切成丝了..{\r}
这是趋势{\r}
还有，我在想啊…{\r}
新的面店，厨房要大，不能老让你猫着腰了{\r}
不错吧?{\r}
阿波,我知道,你的事并未如愿{\r}
看来，这一切都是注定的{\r}
别去想了..{\r}
..你真正的命运还在等着你呢{\r}
我早就说了，我们是面条世家 血液里都流着面汤{\r}
我不知道,老爸{\r}
老实说,有时我都怀疑是不是你的亲生儿子{\r}
波..{\r}
看来，现在我该把有些真相和你说说了{\r}
早就想说的{\r}
好啊{\r}
咱家祖传汤面里放了一种祖传秘方,记得吧{\r}
来，来...这个祖传秘方是…{\r}
没有{\r}
-哈?  -你听见了,没有啊！{\r}
根本就没什么祖传秘方！{\r}
等一下,你是说那只是一碗普通的汤面?{\r}
你根本没加什么秘方酱汁，或其它东西?{\r}
没这必要啊,要让什么东西与众不同..{\r}
你只需相信"它就是与众不同的"就可以了..{\r}
世上根本就没什么秘方{\r}
我回来了,师父{\r}
这里早已不是你家 我也不再是你师父！{\r}
哦,是啊，你另有新爱徒了呢{\r}
那么，那个阿波，哪去了?{\r}
被我吓跑了?{\r}
这场决斗，只在你我{\r}
既如此，那我只好奉陪了{\r}
你必须奉陪！{\r}
我在大牢里蹲了整整20年！！都是拜你所赐！{\r}
尊从师命 绝不是软弱的表现{\r}
你明知 我才配做神龙大侠！{\r}
你早就知道{\r}
但，那乌龟却说“非也”,你做了什么?{\r}
你，做了什么?{\r}
什么也没做!{\r}
你本就不该成为神龙大侠，又岂是我之错！{\r}
非 你 之 错?{\r}
是谁让我怀揣武学梦想？！{\r}
是谁逼我练功练到伤筋错骨？？！{\r}
谁又否决了我成为神龙大侠的一生追求？？？！{\r}
那件事，我根本没有权利做决定{\r}
现在，你有了{\r}
把卷轴 交给我!{\r}
我毋宁死！{\r}
我所做的一切！都是为了让你以我为荣！{\r}
告诉我,师傅,你是多么以我为荣！{\r}
你说啊！{\r}
你说！！{\r}
我..我一直都很以你为荣{\r}
从一开始..我就..{\r}
以你为荣{\r}
然而，正是我这种虚荣{\r}
蒙蔽了我双眼{\r}
我对你的溺爱 让我看不清你的转变{\r}
如今..{\r}
让你走到这一步..{\r}
我..{\r}
我..我真的对不起..{\r}
你以为我想要你的致歉？{\r}
我要我的卷轴！{\r}
怎么？{\r}
卷轴呢？{\r}
神龙大侠早已带着神龙卷轴远走高飞了{\r}
你永远 也看不到那秘笈了,太..郎{\r}
永远..{\r}
永远{\r}
台阶太多了!{\r}
你是哪位？{\r}
哥们,我..就是神龙大侠{\r}
就你？ 哈哈…{\r}
他？他是个熊猫啊{\r}
你只是个熊猫，你能怎么着？压我？{\r}
别惹我{\r}
现在，我可要用这个了{\r}
想要吗？来拿啊{\r}
终于到手{\r}
神龙卷轴是我的!{\r}
快如电！{\r}
卷轴正在赐予他力量！{\r}
不！{\r}
终于…到手了…{\r}
神龙卷轴的无上神功…是我的了！{\r}
怎么是空的？{\r}
别难过，一开始，我也没有搞懂!{\r}
啥？{\r}
根本没有什么祖传秘方{\r}
只有，你自己{\r}
别戳！{\r}
我都想尿尿了{\r}
别戳！{\r}
别，别戳了！{\r}
你..{\r}
怎么可能打败我？{\r}
你..{\r}
你..不过一只又肥..{\r}
又胖的..{\r}
大熊猫而已！{\r}
我不是什么肥又胖的大熊猫…{\r}
我是神龙大侠熊猫{\r}
无式销魂指？！{\r}
噢，你也知道这一招?{\r}
你唬我,你在唬我，师父不可能教你这招{\r}
没错{\r}
我无师自通，  看 招!{\r}
快看啊！{\r}
是神龙大侠!{\r}
那是我儿！那个高大的功夫大侠！他是我儿子！{\r}
来！{\r}
谢谢你，老爸！{\r}
嘿，各位{\r}
大师!{\r}
大师!{\r}
我？大师？{\r}
"师傅"大师！{\r}
师父!{\r}
师父，你怎么样了？{\r}
阿波{\r}
你还活着？{\r}
还是，我们都死了？{\r}
不,师父,我没死，我打败太郎了！{\r}
真的?{\r}
哇噢！果然不出乌龟所料{\r}
你真的是神龙大侠{\r}
果然,你把和平与安宁带给了{\r}
和平谷{\r}
还有…{\r}
..我{\r}
谢谢你!{\r}
谢谢你了！阿波！{\r}
谢谢..谢..{\r}
不！师父,不不不…不要死啊! 师父,求求你!{\r}
我没死！你个白痴！{\r}
哦！神龙大侠{\r}
我只是在享受难得的宁静..终于..（心）宁静了..{\r}
噢！那我最好，先闭嘴？{\r}
拜托了{\r}
要不要..吃点啥？{\r}
要！

『尾幕暗藏惊喜，最后还有彩蛋』{\r}

Kung Fu Fighting这首歌最早诞生于1970S
是受李小龙所兴起的功夫热影响而创作，
至今已有多个版本，功夫熊猫是其中之一。


 导演：约翰·史蒂芬森；马克·奥斯本-   编剧：乔纳森·阿贝尔；格伦·伯杰-    配乐：约翰·鲍威尔；汉斯·季默-  向他们的精彩作品致敬!{\r}
螳螂在早期曾被设计成和太郎密谋的反派{\r}
影片中仙鹤共有6019片羽毛{\r}
猴王由成龙配音，小龙由刘玉玲(美籍华人)配音{\r}

对于中国武学、师道、孝道等的阐释和理解，掌握了真正的精髓！其制作诚意、艺术价值高度，绝非当前中国本土大多数国产片所能比拟。影片配乐一直是一部电影的灵魂，尤其本片的配乐，对中华文化的理解已经达到了“触魂”的高度！却全部是由外国人所作！{\r}
电影中蛇身上共设计了120块骨头{\r}
乌龟仙逝时化作37517片花瓣，场景历时6个月制作完成！{\r}
师傅是只小熊猫，最早设计中师傅还带个眼镜{\r}
