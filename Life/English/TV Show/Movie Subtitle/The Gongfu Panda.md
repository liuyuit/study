# Kung fu Panda

- Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
- He travels the land in search of worthy foes.



- I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!

- The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full.

- The he swallowed.  And then he spoke. Enough talk. Let's fight!

  

- He was so deadly in fact.
- That his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure  awesomeness.
- My eyes! He's too awesome!
- And attractive. How can we repay you?



- There is no charge for awesomness 

- Or attractiveness.

- it  mattered no how many foes he faced

- They were no match for his bodacity!

  

- Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.

- Even the most heroic heroes in China, The Furous Five.

- Bowed in respect to this great master.

- We should hang out.

- Agreed.

  

- But hanging out have to wait

- Because when you're facing the ten thousand demands of demand mountain

- There's one thing that matters

- Po, get up.

- You'll be later for work.

  

- Po, get up.

- Po , what are you doing up here.

- Po! Let's go! you're late for work

- coming
