**Dialogue**

So, I have some good news. We’re going to Tala for the conference.

We need to decide on a venue. What would you suggest?

Why do you think we should go to the Tala Royal?

OK, sounds good. How long do you think we should go for?

That’s quite a long time. Maybe three days would be better?

What will we do there?

Do you have any idea about the facilities we’ll need?

That’s a good idea. We can have a big meeting at the start and then some smaller meetings before the team building.

Thanks for your help. I think we have a good plan now.
