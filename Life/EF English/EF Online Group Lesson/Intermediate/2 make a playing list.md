Share with the class your favourite song/genre. Explain why this is important to you?



Daphne: classical music it helps you to relax and feel good. The music is gorgeous and very calming. You can feel the emotions of the song. 



Ceci: My favourite song is a song that my mother sang to me when I was 5 years old. It was created by my mother 20 years ago, when I sing the song I feel calm and my emotions settle. My mum created this song for me so it's very special to me. I remember the good times from my childhood. 



Joyce: My favourite song is my heart will go by Celine Dion. She has a great voice, the lyrics are romantic like the movie. The music is close to my heart, i really enjoy it. 



Kevin: I don't wanna miss a thing. It's a catchy song from the rock & roll genre. The melody is very catchy and breathtaking and beautiful. I like it very much.
