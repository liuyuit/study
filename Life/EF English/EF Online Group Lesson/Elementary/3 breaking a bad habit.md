​							**Breaking a bad habit**



One of my habits is eating junk food. I eat too many cookies and sweets. 

It could make me fat.



I sleep very late. I always play on my phone at night. 

I also eat too many hamburgers! I go to the gym 3 times a week to break this habit.



I always read novels or watch movies before going to bed, so I go to bed late. It's not good for my work, so I want to break the habit.



I always play computer games too late.



Smoking is a bad habit, I want to break it as it is bad for my own and other's health.



It's not clean- unhygienic 



It's impolite



Spread the virus during a pandemic



Natural Reaction- uncontrollable 



Maybe they're sick



Distract others



I go to bed at 12am sometimes! I want to go to bed **earlier.**



You should do exercise so you are more tired!



Eat junk food- too many instant noodles!



Stick to a habit



I smoke too many cigarettes !





Chewing gum

E-cigarette
